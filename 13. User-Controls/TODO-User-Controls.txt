Hi guys,

I graduated from the academy last year and I would like to give some feedback in relation to the Asp.net development track.

I would like to suggest introducing the topic: Creating Asp.net Custom server controls. They are widely used in Sitefinity and the Asp teams.
Because Custom server controls is a huge topic, I suggest focusing on mainly: 
1.	Creating controls that inherit from WebControl & IScriptControl. ( here is a good topic on the matter http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386450.aspx)
2.	Implementing Client side functionality for the server control. 
a.	Creating the Javascript class, that corresponds to the server control.
b.	Implementing Js events, delegates, properties, inheritance etc.. 
c.	Client side data binding to Wcf Rest services.

If you have any questions regarding this email, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Best regards,
